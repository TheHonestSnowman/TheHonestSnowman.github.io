            <p>Andrew Freestone</p></br>
            <p>I played sports from a young age, but my interest in health and fitness didn’t start until 2014 when I first lived away from home at university. I started to follow advice that was either bad or not suited to me, which led to on-off diets and exercise which I didn’t enjoy and I found it hard to stick with.</p></br>

            <p>I decided to do my own research and then apply what I was learning in ways that suited me, so that I could improve and work towards my fitness goals. It became enjoyable and I made progress and I wanted to use the information to help others.</p></br>
                
            <p>My aim is to use the information I have learnt to help you to avoid the mistakes that many people make regarding health and fitness. To personalise a plan for you that it is enjoyable and you can stick to it long-term because it fits and becomes your lifestyle.</p>
